Django Tagging Select2
======================

|travis-develop| |coverage-develop|

This is my fork of django tagging https://github.com/Fantomas42/django-tagging but with added support for Select2 (>=v4.0.0)

This is a generic tagging application for Django projects

http://django-tagging.readthedocs.org/

Note that this application requires Python 2.7 or later, and Django
1.7 or later. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and
Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
